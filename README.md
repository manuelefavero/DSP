# Short Sound Recognition With A Simple Audio Fingerprinting System

## Introduction

This project explores the feasibility of using an **audio fingerprinting system** for recognizing **TIS (Transmission of Information Sound) codes**. TIScode is an application that transmits information through sound, similar to QR codes but without requiring a camera. The project investigates whether audio fingerprinting can reliably identify TIScodes under various conditions, including **background noise** and **smartphone microphone frequency response variations**.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:

1. **TIScodes**: Short 5-second sound messages generated using MusicGen.
2. **Anechoic Chamber Recordings**: Frequency response measurements from **seven different smartphones** (OnePlus 8T, iPhone 13, Samsung Galaxy A54, etc.).
3. **Noise Datasets**:
   - **Hospital Noise Dataset**: Contains ambient sounds recorded in hospitals (e.g., doors, conversations, equipment sounds).
   - **Ambient Sound Dataset**: Includes various everyday background noises (wind, white noise, thunderstorm, etc.).

## System Setup

### 1. Frequency Response Calculation
- A 10-second **sweep signal (20Hz - 20kHz)** was played and recorded using multiple smartphones.
- The **frequency response** of each smartphone's microphone was estimated using **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**.
- An **inverse filter** was applied to correct the frequency response distortions.

### 2. Audio Fingerprinting System
- A **constellation map** approach was used to extract **peak frequencies and their time positions**.
- **Hashes** were generated by pairing frequency peaks and encoding them into **32-bit integer values**.
- The system compared hashes from recorded TIScodes to a database for recognition.

## Testing and Results

- The recognition system was evaluated under different **noise conditions** and **TIScode attenuation levels (0, -3, -6, -9 dB)**.
- Without noise correction, the system correctly identified TIScodes **67% of the time** when noise and TIScode were of equal intensity.
- With **6 dB noise attenuation**, accuracy improved to **93.2%**.
- The system outperformed the **state-of-the-art TIScode matching method**, which only achieved **11% accuracy**.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing **advanced noise reduction techniques** and **AI-powered denoising**.
- Testing on **higher-end smartphones** to analyze the effect of better microphone quality.
- Improving **real-time processing capabilities** for deployment in practical applications.
